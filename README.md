### Podcast Notes: 

<https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/asty-podcast/episodio-14-crowdfunding-1ljNFHi-B72/#1>

- technological problem easier than legal issues (7:25)

- companies in Mexico have until Sept. 10, 2019 to qualify under new Fintech law for operating license

- first investment $1.5M / 40% used first version of platform (80% tech engineering/20% legal setup). Remainder for Operating Budget

- Regulation always follows innovation.  It would be like having traffic laws before cars.

- Fintech laws allows for larger investors to enter market because it provides solid legal framework.

- Biggest obstacle was fighting "status quo".  Convincing people a new way was possible and could be profitable

- Currently only have 4 properties in the system.  Have 12 properties in the pipeline

- Also offer pre-sales of properties, which helps developers with financing.  Easier to split an office building into fractions that are 
maintained by one entity (100Ladrillos), versus having many owners that may not maintain the building to the same standards.

- Still have to go through process of Know Your Customer to prevent money laundering.
